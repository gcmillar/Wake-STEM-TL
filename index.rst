Aligning Computational Thinking with Tangible Landscape for Forest Fire Spread Modeling
========================================================================================

Grade level/course: Grade 9

Curriculum Developers: Michael A. Evans & Garrett Millar

Description
-----------
This lesson plan leads students through an introduction to computational science and applying its core concepts to real-world spatial phenomenon. Specifically, the lesson outlines the topic of Forest Fire Spread as a geohazard, aligned with geospatial modeling, geospatial technologies, and computer programming activities. Geospatial and computational thinking skills will be taught and developed, to then be put to the test on the last day of the lesson plan with  `Tangible Landscape <https://tangible-landscape.github.io/>`_.

Earth & Environmental Science Standards Covered
-------------------------------------------------
* EEn.2.1.4 - Explain the probability of and precautions that can be made to protect life from various geohazards such as: landslides, avalanches, earthquakes, and volcanoes in a particular area based on available data (including meteorological hazards).

Objectives
-----------
1. Understand forest fires and their effects with various simulations
2. Understand Computational Thinking concepts as they apply to modeling geohazards
3. Understand Geospatial Thinking concepts and Tangible Landscapes
4. Develop Computational and Geospatial Thinking skills

Software
---------

Several geospatial (GIS) tools such as GRASS GIS and ArcGIS
will be discussed in connection with geography-related topics covered in the lesson plan as related to computational science.

All the software used in the course is open source, so students can
install it on their computers without obtaining licenses from the vendors
or through the university. Some free of charge services based on open
source software or focused on open science or open source development
will be used too.
