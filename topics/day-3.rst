Day 3: Introduction to GIS
==========================================

Today you will be introduced to GIS methods and common practices by completing ArcGIS learning modules. Through completion of the learning modules, you will explore online maps and apps, interpret maps, and begin to understand spatial analysis.

Objectives
-----------

* Explore how maps can provide insight into spatial information and patterns
* Learn how maps can be used to tell stories
* Discover ways in which maps can be used to perform geospatial analysis
* Investigate how historical maps can envision the past and be used to investigate spatial changes over time
