Day 4: Geospatial modeling and analyses of wildfire spread
============================================================

Today is about using the knowledge you have gained from the previously completed ArcGIS learning modules by investigating and applying applications of GIS techniques for limiting wildfire spread across heavily populated areas. You will use ArcGIS ArcMap to investigate forest fire management questions related to the historic 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires.

For the second portion of the lesson, you will explore a more computational approach for fighting California forest fires using spatial analysis. Using the ArcGIS API for Python—a powerful yet easy to use Pythonic library for performing GIS visualization, analysis, and spatial data management using scripts—you will apply spatial analysis tools (buffer, overlay) to automate the identification process for facilities at risk from forest fires.

Objectives
-----------

* Determine the location of the fires as well as the number of acres burned
* Understand how GIS was used to assist in the management of those fires such as using buffers to select facilities within two miles of the fire
* Discover the primary cause of the forest fires by, for example, investigating the relationship between fire starts and roads
